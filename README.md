# Survey dashboard

A dashboard to display survey data in an interactive way.

## Overview

A dashboard using bokeh sever, developed to display data from HMC surveys in an interactive explorer way.

## Installation


## Usage
* In the top folder execute:
```
bokeh serve --show dashboard
```


* Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.


## Development

To embed the dashboard into any website, first you have to host a bokeh server with this application somewhere and then you can embed it with bokehs `sever_document` function [see](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html#app-documents)

Do steps under `usage` above, but for a public exposed URL.

Add the code from 'script' to you website:

```python
from bokeh.embed import server_document
script = server_document("url_to_running_server")
script
```
