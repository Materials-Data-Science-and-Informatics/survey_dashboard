# Survey dashboard

A dashboard to display survey data in an interactive way.

## Overview

This repository contains a dashboard using Panel and Bokeh, developed to display data from 
HMC surveys in an interactive exploratory way. It is designed such that the code for the interactive
visualizations might be reused for other projects.
Example of a deployed version can be found [here](https://dashboard.survey.helmholtz-metadaten.de/survey_dashboard)

## Installation

After downloading the git repository you can install the software either with pip or poetry.
We recommend setting it up in a separate python virtual environment.

```shell
pip install survey_dashboard
```
or

```shell
poetry install .
```

## Usage


After installation you can start the app, i.e the panel server/bokeh server.
```shell
panel serve --port 50006 survey_dashboard/ 
```
If you have given the dashboard a specific layout like the layout specific to HMC, which is on the hmc_specific branch, you might have to link to to a specific template.
```shell
panel serve --port 50006 survey_dashboard/ --static-dirs en_files=./survey_dashboard/hmc_layout/static/en_files

```

* Navigate to `http://localhost:50006/` in your browser.

## Deployment

To embed the dashboard into any website, first you have to host a bokeh server with this application somewhere and then you can embed it with bokehs `sever_document` function [see](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html#app-documents)

Do steps under `usage` above, but for a public exposed URL, or what ever is used for deployment.
The Language verison of the dashboard can be set with the environment variable: 'L


Add the code from 'script' to you website:

```python
from bokeh.embed import server_document
script = server_document("url_to_running_server")
script
```
