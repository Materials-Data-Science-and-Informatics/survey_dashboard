# Survey dashboard

A dashboard to display survey data in an interactive way.

## Overview

A dashboard using bokeh sever, developed to display data from HMC surveys in an interactive explorer way.

## Installation

After downloading the git repository you can install the software either with pip or poetry.
We recomment setting it up in a seperate pyhon virtual environment.

```shell
pip install survey_dashboard
```
or

```shell
poetry install .
```


## Usage

After installation you can start the app, i.e the panel server/bokeh server.
```shell
panel serve --port 50006 survey_dashboard/ 
```
If you have given the dashboard a specific layout like the layout specific to HMC, which is on the hmc_specific branch, you might have to 
```shell
panel serve --port 50006 survey_dashboard/ --static-dirs en_files=./survey_dashboard/hmc_layout/static/en_files
```

* Navigate to `http://localhost:50006/` in your browser.


## Development

To embed the dashboard into any website, first you have to host a bokeh server with this application somewhere and then you can embed it with bokehs `sever_document` function [see](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/embed.html#app-documents)

Do steps under `usage` above, but for a public exposed URL.

Add the code from 'script' to you website:

```python
from bokeh.embed import server_document
script = server_document("url_to_running_server")
script
```
