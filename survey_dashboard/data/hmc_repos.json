To address these gaps, as well as other important questions on how to improve outcomes, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), in partnership with the Department of Defense (DoD), is building a secure, centralized informatics system (database) for TBI research. It will serve as a central repository for new data, link to current databases and allow valid comparison of results across studies. The database builds upon an effort to create common data elements for the study of TBI - which are essentially definitions and guidelines about the kinds of data that should be collected, and how to collect these data in clinical studies.","resourceUri":["https://fitbir.nih.gov/"],"keyword":["Open-Access Medical Image Repository"],"scientificDiscipline":["Life Science: Health Science","Life Science: Medicine"],"helmholtzResearchField":["Health"],"repositoryType":["disciplinary"],"repositoryLanguage":["en"],"contentType":["images"],"Link to Organization":"NIH","mappingCategory":"repository"},{"_id":"A8979AF24A7838B6B1E237E25201BA9C","resourceName":[{"name":"Open Access Series Of Imaging Studies","nameType":"name","nameLanguage":"en"},{"name":"OASIS","nameType":"abbreviation","nameLanguage":"en"}],"resourceDescription":"OASIS-3 is the latest release in the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) that is aimed at making neuroimaging datasets freely available to the scientific community.
